### What is Lista DAO? <a href="#what-is-lista" id="what-is-lista"></a>

Lista DAO functions as the open-source decentralized stablecoin lending protocol powered by LSDfi. Users can perform staking and liquid staking on Lista DAO, as well as borrow lisUSD against a variety of decentralized collateral. Present on the BNB Chain and Ethereum, Lista DAO aims to position lisUSD as the number one stablecoin in the crypto space, leveraging on innovative liquid staking solutions.

### Is Lista DAO audited? <a href="#is-lista-audited" id="is-lista-audited"></a>

Yes, Lista DAO is audited multiple times by some of the best Web3 security auditors in the space such as Peckshield, Veridise, Slowmist, Blocksec and Supremacy. You can find the audit reports [here](https://docs.bsc.lista.org/security).

### What is lisUSD? <a href="#what-is-lisusd" id="what-is-lisusd"></a>

lisUSD is Lista DAO’s decentralized stablecoin pegged to the USD, and is fully over-collateralized by crypto assets such as BNB, ETH, slisBNB and wBETH. In phase 1, lisUSD leverages on the MakerDAO models on BNB Chain for a decentralized and unbiased stablecoin product.

### What is slisBNB <a href="#what-is-slisbnb" id="what-is-slisbnb"></a>

slisBNB is the native yield bearing and liquid staking token for BNB, built by Lista DAO. slisBNB appreciates against BNB in line with BNB’s staking APR, allowing users have the freedom to earn additional yields on different DeFi platforms while earning staking rewards passively.

### What is collateral? <a href="#what-is-collateral" id="what-is-collateral"></a>

Collateral is any asset which a borrower must provide to take out a loan, acting as a security for the debt.

### What does collateral ratio mean? <a href="#what-does-collateral-ratio-mean" id="what-does-collateral-ratio-mean"></a>

This is the ratio between the dollar value of the collateral deposited by the borrower and amount of debt borrowed in lisUSD.

The collateral ratio will fluctuate over time as the price of the collateral changes. Borrowers can influence the ratio by adjusting collateral and/or debt — i.e. adding more collateral or paying off some of your debt in lisUSD.

For example: Let’s say the current price of BNB is $2000 and you decide to deposit 1 BNB as collateral. If you borrow 400 lisUSD, then the collateral ratio for your debt position would be 2000:400 = 500%. If you borrowed 1000 lisUSD, then the collateral ratio of your debt position would be 2000:1000 = 200% instead.

### What is the minimum collateral ratio & borrow amount to borrow lisUSD? <a href="#what-is-the-minimum-collateral-ratio-and-borrow-amount-to-borrow-lisusd" id="what-is-the-minimum-collateral-ratio-and-borrow-amount-to-borrow-lisusd"></a>

### How can users earn on lisUSD? <a href="#how-can-users-earn-on-lisusd" id="how-can-users-earn-on-lisusd"></a>

Users can earn with lisUSD in a variety of ways. They can stake their lisUSD on ListaDAO, which accrues lisUSD rewards. They can provide liquidity for slisBNB and lisUSD in various liquidity pools such as PancakeSwap, Wombat Exchange, ThenaFi, Curve and Uniswap to further earn trading and LP fees.

Please note that while we strive to maintain price stability, lisUSD may not always be perfectly pegged to the USD, and it can deviate slightly in both directions under stressful market conditions.

### Will my position be liquidated on Lista DAO? <a href="#will-my-position-be-liquidated-on-lista" id="will-my-position-be-liquidated-on-lista"></a>

Yes, liquidations are a common concept in lending protocols like Lista DAO, and thus, users need to be aware that their loan positions are at risk of being liquidated if they no longer have sufficient collateral to maintain the MCR of the loan.

For example, if you are a borrower, and the value of your collateral drops below the MCR of 150%, liquidation will occur. You will still keep your borrowed lisUSD, but your borrowed position will be closed and your collateral will be used to compensate liquidators.

### Are users at risk of losing their funds? <a href="#are-users-at-risk-of-losing-their-funds" id="are-users-at-risk-of-losing-their-funds"></a>

As a non-custodial system, all the tokens sent to the protocol will be held and managed by smart contracts without the interference of any person or legal entity. That means your funds will only be subject to the rules set forth in the smart contract code.

Although Lista DAO has rigorously designed our platform and audited our code, there may be additional unforeseen risks, and thus not all risks can be fully excluded.any DeFi protocol and investment carries risk. Lista DAO has made our code and audit reports available online, and users are welcome to assess the risk themselves.

Lista DAO is currently in the initial development stages and there are a variety of unforeseeable risks. You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with acquiring LISTA, holding LISTA, and using LISTA for participation in Lista DAO. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of LISTA held. IF YOU DECIDE TO ACQUIRE LISTA OR PARTICIPATE IN LISTA DAO, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:

■ Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions: The regulatory status of Lista DAO, LISTA and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of digital assets has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including LISTA and/or Lista DAO. Regulatory actions could negatively impact LISTA and/or Lista DAO in various ways. Lista DAO or any of its affiliates may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors to mitigate the legal risks as much as possible, Lista DAO have worked with the specialist blockchain department at GS Legal LLC and obtained a legal opinion on the token distribution, and will be conducting business in accordance with the prevailing market practice.

■ Inadequate disclosure of information: As at the date hereof, Lista DAO is still under development and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although this material contains the most current information relating to Lista DAO, it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Lista DAO from time to time. The Lista DAO has neither the ability nor obligation to keep holders of LISTA informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop Lista DAO, hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

■ Failure to develop: There is the risk that the development of Lista DAO will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or LISTA, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

■ Security weaknesses: Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with LISTA and/or Lista DAO in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of Lista DAO or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of LISTA and/or Lista DAO, which could negatively affect LISTA and/or Lista DAO. Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to LISTA and/or Lista DAO by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.

■ Risk of Dissolution: Early-stage projects such as Lista DAO involve a high degree of risk. Financial and operating risks confronting start-up companies are significant, and the aforementioned entities are not immune to these. Start-up companies often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, and general management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved. It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, decrease in the utility of LISTA due to negative adoption of Lista DAO, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership related challenges, Lista DAO may no longer be viable to operate and Lista DAO may be dissolved.

■ Other risks: In addition, the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with your participation in Lista DAO, as well as acquisition of, holding and use of LISTA, including those that Lista DAO cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on Lista DAO, its affiliates, as well as understand the overall framework, mission and vision for Lista DAO prior to participating in the same and/or acquiring LISTA.
