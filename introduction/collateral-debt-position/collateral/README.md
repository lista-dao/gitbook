Other than classic collateral assets such as ETH and BNB, Lista DAO also offers two particular asset classes as collateral on our lisUSD lending platform, LSTs, and LRTs.

### Liquid staking Tokens (LSTs)

Liquid staking tokens represent a user's staked assets on a blockchain network. These tokens allow users to participate in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks without sacrificing liquidity.

Traditionally, when a user stake their cryptocurrency in a PoS network, the assets are locked up for a certain period and cannot be used. Liquid staking introduces a tokenized version of these staked assets that users can trade, sell, or use in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications while they're still staked.

These liquid staking tokens are usually issued at a 1:1 ratio to the staked assets and earn rewards in the same way as the original staked assets. Therefore, they allow users to simultaneously secure the network, earn staking rewards, and have the flexibility to participate in other parts of the crypto economy.

### Liquid restaking tokens (LRTs)

Restaking refers to the process of staking an asset again after it has already been staked once. This method allows the staked asset to be utilized in a different staking program or on another platform, increasing its utility and providing the holder with additional rewards, although this comes with heightened risks of slashing.

Liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) is a specific variant of this process, which involves liquid staking tokens. Here, a staker initially commits their assets to a validator and receives a token that represents this stake. The staker can then use this liquid staking token to participate in a restaking protocol, further leveraging their initial investment.
