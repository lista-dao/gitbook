# LRT Collateral Options

Restaking refers to the process of staking an asset again after it has already been staked once. This method allows the staked asset to be utilized in a different staking program or on another platform, increasing its utility and providing the holder with additional rewards, although this comes with heightened risks of slashing.

Liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) is a specific variant of this process, which involves liquid staking tokens. Here, a staker initially commits their assets to a validator and receives a token that represents this stake. The staker can then use this liquid staking token to participate in a restaking protocol, further leveraging their initial investment.

Here are the available Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) that can be used as collateral to borrow lisUSD:

* weETH (Ether.fi)
* ezETH (Renzo Protocol)
