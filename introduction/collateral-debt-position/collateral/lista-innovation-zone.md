# Lista Innovation Zone

The Lista Innovation Zone is a new initiative by Lista DAO designed to integrate new Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) and Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) into our ecosystem, by listing them as potential collateral options for borrowing lisUSD. This move reflects our commitment to keeping pace with the rapid innovations in the crypto and DeFi landscapes, ensuring that Lista does not fall behind in adopting new technologies and asset classes.

However, we are also aware of the increased risks associated with these new assets which could compromise the stability and security of Lista’s platform. Hence, assets that are listed under Lista’s innovation zone will be subjected to more stringent security checks, and higher collateral ratio requirements.

Below is the list of assets under the Lista Innovation Zone:

* weETH (Etherfi)
* ezETH (Renzo Protocol)
* BBTC (Bouncebit)
* solvBTC (Solv Protocol)
* STONE (Stakestone)
