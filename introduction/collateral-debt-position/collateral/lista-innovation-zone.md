# Lista Innovation Zone

The Lista Innovation Zone is a new initiative by Lista DAO designed to integrate new Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) and Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) into our ecosystem, by listing them as potential collateral options for borrowing lisUSD. This move reflects our commitment to keeping pace with the rapid innovations in the crypto and DeFi landscapes, ensuring that Lista does not fall behind in adopting new technologies and asset classes.

However, we are also aware of the increased risks associated with these new assets, such as potential exploits and depegging events, which could compromise the stability and security of Lista’s platform. The Lista Innovation Zone represents our strategy to strike a delicate balance between embracing the fast-paced growth of the DeFi sector and maintaining the highest standards of safety and security for our users. This initiative will enable us to explore new possibilities cautiously and responsibly, ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of our users’ trust and the integrity of our platform.

Hence, assets that are listed under Lista’s innovation zone will be subjected to more stringent security checks, and higher collateral ratio requirements.

Below is the list of assets under the Lista Innovation Zone:

* weETH (Etherfi)
* ezETH (Renzo Protocol)
* BBTC (Bouncebit)
* solvBTC (Solv Protocol)
* STONE (Stakestone)
