### lisUSD's price stability mechanism[​](https://helio.money/docs/price-stability#hays-price-stability-mechanism)​ <a href="#hays-price-stability-mechanism" id="hays-price-stability-mechanism"></a>

Lista DAO is able to maintain lisUSD’s $1 value with respect to USD in the following scenarios:

**When lisUSD > $1, the supply of lisUSD needs to increase:**

* Since lisUSD is at a premium, borrowers are incentivised to borrow more lisUSD to sell for other assets for arbitrage opportunities.
* To reduce demand for lisUSD farming, Lista DAO will reduce lisUSD farming rewards by decreasing lisUSD borrowing interest.

**When lisUSD< $1, the supply of lisUSD needs to decrease**

Comment

* Since lisUSD is at a discount, borrowers are incentivised to buy lisUSD from the market to pay back the debt.
* To decrease lisUSD borrowing demand, Lista DAO will increase lisUSD borrowing interest, which increases lisUSD farming rewards
