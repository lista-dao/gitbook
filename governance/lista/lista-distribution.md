# LISTA distribution

## Circulating supply at launch&#x20;

Circulating supply refers to the total amount of LISTA tokens that are freely available for trading, without any specific transfer restrictions.&#x20;

Here are the details of Lista’s circulating supply upon launch:

1. Upon launch, 10% of LISTA’s total token supply allocated towards Binance Megadrop was unlocked.
2. Upon launch, 8.5% of LISTA’s total token supply allocated towards our Airdrop campaign was unlocked.&#x20;
3. Upon launch, 3.5% of LISTA’s total token supply allocated towards ecosystem growth was unlocked.
4. Upon launch, 1% of LISTA’s total token supply allocated towards investors & advisors was unlocked.&#x20;

This brings the total circulating supply of LISTA at launch (June 20) to be set at 23%, or 230,000,000 LISTA tokens.

### The table below is a breakdown of LISTA's token distribution.

| Token Name           | Lista                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Binance Megadrop     | 10.00% of the total token supply |
| Airdrop              | 10.00% of the total token supply |
| Investors & Advisors | 19.00% of the total token supply |
| Team                 | 3.50% of the total token supply  |
| Community            | 40.00% of the total token supply |
| DAO Treasury         | 8.00% of the total token supply  |
| Ecosystem            | 9.50% of the total token supply  |

### Binance Megadrop (10.00%)

The entirety of the token supply allocated towards Binance Megadrop, will be unlocked on launch.

### Airdrop (10.00%)

At Launch, 85% of the tokens allocated to the Lista DAO’s airdrop, equating to 8.5% of the total token supply, will be unlocked.&#x20;

The remaining 15%, which is 1.5% of LISTA’s total token supply, will be unlocked by the end of September.

### Investors & advisors (19.00%)

1% of the total token supply allocated towards investors & advisors will be unlocked on launch.

The remaining 18% will be locked for a one-year cliff until June 2025. From June 2025 onwards, this portion will be vested and unlocked linearly every quarter over the next two years until March 2027.

### Team (3.50%)

100% of the token supply allocated to the Lista DAO team (3.50%) will be locked for a 1 year cliff until June 2025, with the first unlock happening in June 2025.

From June 2025 onwards, the 3.50% token supply allocated towards the Lista DAO team will be vested and unlocked linearly every quarter (3 months) over the next 5 years until March 2029.

### Community (40.00%)

Upon launch, the token supply allocated towards community incentives will be channeled towards token emissions to incentivise various DeFi activities on Lista DAO such as LPs rewards, lisUSD single staking pool, etc.&#x20;

LISTA Token emissions towards these community incentives will kickstart in July, and the emissions will continue to be released at a decreasing rate of 1/√2 each year, for the next 20 years until June 2044.&#x20;

The token emission for community incentives will follow the formula: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png>)

**n**: When  n = 1 , it represents the token emissions for the first year. In the final year, n=20

**r**: r is the common ratio of the geometric series: 1/√2&#x20;

**S**: S is the sum of the geometric series: which is 40% of the token emissions, equating to 400 million LISTA

As Lista DAO is still in its transition phase, the current emission rate is set at 312,500 LISTA per week, which is lower than the expected emission rate of 9,772,651 LISTA per month.&#x20;

This rate is divided as follows:

* veLISTA Holders: 250,000 LISTA/week
* Lista DAO related LPs: 62,500 LISTA/week

#### Lista DAO Transition Phase

During Lista DAO’s transition towards a fully decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO), the originally planned emissions for Lista DAO, which is 9,772,651 LISTA tokens/month in the first year, will be split into 2 equal portions of 4,886,325.5 LISTA tokens each.

First Half: The first half of the LISTA token emissions (4,886,325.5 LISTA/month in the first year) will be dynamically adjusted each month based on current needs. Prior to the emission of this portion, the community will be duly notified.

Second Half: The second half of the Lista token emissions (4,886,325.5 LISTA/month in the first year) will be channeled towards community incentives but not emitted immediately. The emission amount will gradually increase based on the progress of Lista’s platform deployment. The increase in emissions will be capped at 1,221,581 LISTA/week, or in other words, 4,886,325.5 LISTA/month in the long run.

As of now, the emission rate of LISTA is currently set at 312,500 LISTA/week. All remaining unissued LISTA tokens will continue to be allocated to community incentives, with future decisions on emission rates determined through DAO voting. As we complete our transition to a DAO, the power to adjust LISTA’s current emission parameters will also progressively shift to veLISTA holders.

### DAO treasury (8.00%)

100% of the token supply allocated towards Lista DAO’s treasury (8.00%) will be locked for a 3 month cliff until September 2024, with the first unlock happening in September 2024.

From September 2024 onwards, the 8.00% token supply allocated towards Lista DAO’s treasury will be vested and unlocked linearly every quarter (3 months) over the next 4 years until June 2028.

### Ecosystem (9.50%)

3.50% of the total token supply allocated towards ecosystem incentives will be unlocked on launch.

The remaining 6% of the token supply allocated towards ecosystem incentives will be unlocked every quarter (3 months) for the next 5 years until June 2029 according to the table below:
