## Understanding veLISTA & veToken model <a href="#id-91ff" id="id-91ff"></a>

To understand how users can obtain veLISTA and what purpose veLISTA serves, we must first understand what veToken model is. The veTOKEN model, introduced by Curve Finance, is a tokenomics mechanism designed to align incentives and encourage long-term commitment among token holders. In this model, users lock their tokens (referred to as “veTokens”) for a specified period, during which they receive governance power and various rewards. The longer the lock period, the more veTokens they receive, translating to greater voting power and higher rewards.

This system incentivizes users to commit to the protocol for extended periods, fostering stability and aligning their interests with the long-term success of the platform. Hence, Lista’s token locking into veLISTA is inspired by, and functions similarly to, the Curve Finance’s veToken model.

## The road to decentralization <a href="#d418" id="d418"></a>

During Lista DAO’s transition into our veToken model, governance will be gradually passed on to veLISTA holders. Users will be able to vote on several parameters. However, this shift toward a fully decentralized governance model will be gradual rather than instantaneous.

To ensure system security and prevent malicious actions, the core team will initially retain the power to veto harmful proposals, aligning with our mission to prioritize the best interests of Lista DAO. As Lista DAO matures, more power will be gradually transferred to the DAO. Our ultimate goal is to fully transition into a DAO where governance holds absolute power.

Additionally, once veLISTA is launched, veLISTA holders will begin receiving protocol fees, further incentivizing active participation in governance and the long-term success of Lista DAO.
