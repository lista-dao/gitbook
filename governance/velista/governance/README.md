# Governance

## Scope

Voting empowers the Lista DAO community, allowing members to influence and shape the future development of Lista DAO. As Lista DAO matures, more power will be gradually transferred to the DAO. Our ultimate goal is to fully transition into a DAO where governance holds absolute power.

Explore Lista DAO’s native voting portal on Snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/listavote.eth).

veLISTA holders possess voting rights within Lista’s governance system. As Lista DAO matures, more topics will be added into the scope for governance. The following topics currently falls within the scope of governance:

1. Modifying fees rate: withdrawal fees, early Unlock fees for veLISTA
2. Adding of a new collateral
3. Increase and decrease Collateral Rate and collateral debt cap
4. Protocol fee sharing for veLISTA holder
5. Voting on the share of LISTA Emission on Liquidity Pool

_Note\* Collateral options  from the Lista Innovation Zone can be removed without requiring a governance vote. This allows us to swiftly and efficiently remove any collateral deemed risky, ensuring the process remains smooth and protects the platform from potential vulnerabilities._

All governance proposals must be voted on by veLISTA holders, while only the Lista DAO Core team can submit proposals. The results of proposals will be implemented by the Lista DAO team.

Community proposals, posted by the Lista DAO community, are used to propose ideas and express the community’s point of view. The Lista DAO team will incorporate well-supported ideas or designs into Core proposals. Additionally, community members can provide feedback and make suggestions on our Forum, contributing to the ongoing development of the protocol.&#x20;

## Voting Threshold

Governance of Lista DAO operates under specific rules & conditions:

1. Voting Eligibility: Users with any amount of veLISTA are entitled to vote on proposals. Their voting power is directly proportional to the amount of veLISTA they hold relative to other veLISTA holders.
2. Proposal Submission: Only core team members can submit proposals for voting.
3. Voting period: Each proposal’s voting period will last for a period of 3 days, before the final results are tallied
4. Proposal Approval: A proposal is considered approved when it receives support from over 50% of the veLISTA tokens cast in the vote.
5. Implementation: Once a proposal is passed, it will be implemented within 1 to 2 weeks. If there are delays due to special circumstances, the Lista core team will provide an explanation.

## Veto

The Lista DAO Core Team has always prioritized the best interests of Lista DAO. That said, the team retains veto rights and can take corrective actions to ensure the security and proper functioning of the protocol without a Snapshot poll. In any veto action, the Lista Core Team will provide a detailed explanation to the community.

Possible actions include, but are not limited to:

* Pausing relevant smart contracts to fix a critical bug in the protocol
* Rejecting a successfully added gauge if the token(s) in question are deemed unsafe, malicious, and/or detrimental to the Lista’s ecosystem
