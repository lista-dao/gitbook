# veLISTA emissions

To incentivize user participation in liquidity pools and borrowing/staking lisUSD, LISTA offers community incentives in the form of LISTA emission towards the following type of users:

* LP providers for slisBNB, lisUSD, and LISTA
* Users who single stakes lisUSD
* lisUSD borrowers
* slisBNB Holders
* Users who swaps against lisUSD pools

## Rewards breakdown

To recap, according to our [tokenomics](broken-reference), 40% of LISTA's remaining supply will be channeled towards community incentives. The emission percentages are allocated towards various pools and programs, which includes 3 different categories:

1. Referral program (5%)
2. LP pools (33%)
3. Exchange incentives (2%)

The ratio is currently set by the Lista DAO team. In the future, this ratio can be adjusted through governance.
