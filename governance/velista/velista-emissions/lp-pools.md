## External LPs

When users stake their LP tokens on Lista DAO, we restake those tokens to external DeFi platforms like PancakeSwap and Thena Finance. Through this process, users receive dual rewards—they earn LISTA emissions from Lista DAO as well as farming/LP rewards from PancakeSwap (in CAKE rewards) and Thena (in THE rewards).

Lista DAO supports a variety of LP tokens from popular DeFi protocols, allowing users to stake and earn rewards efficiently. The supported LP tokens includes the following:

| **Protocol**  | **Pool Name**              |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Pancake Swap  | lisUSD/USDT stable pool LP |
| Thena Finance | LISTA/USDT Narrow LP       |
|               | slisBNB/BNB correlated LP  |
|               | lisUSD/FRAX(stable) LP     |
|               | lisUSD/USDT(cl stable) LP  |
|               | lisUSD/BNB ICHI LP         |

**rules and conditions:**

1. **Staking on Lista DAO**: Users can stake their PancakeSwap lisUSD/USDT Stable LP tokens directly on Lista DAO by following[ this link](https://lista.org/rewards).
2. **Restaking on External Platforms**: Lista DAO restakes the staked LP tokens into external platforms, such as PancakeSwap farming, where additional rewards are generated. For PancakeSwap, users can view the farming details[ here](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms).
3. **Real-Time APR Display**: Users can track both the LP Emission APR and the LP Restake APR in real time. The total APR is a combination of the rewards from Lista DAO emissions and those earned from the external platform’s farm rewards.
4. Every **Wednesday at 0:00 UTC**, the weekly emission rate for each pool highlighted below will be updated. This ensures that users receive real-time token emissions as they stake LP tokens or borrow/stake lisUSD. The emission schedule is fully transparent, and users can track their updated rewards each week.
