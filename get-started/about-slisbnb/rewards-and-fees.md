# Rewards and Fees

Staking rewards are received for delegating BNB to ListaDAO's validator. Validator take its cut from rewards before sharing it to the protocol as claimable tokens. The rewards earned are split into two parts:

* **95% goes to slisBNB holders** in the form of slisBNB value appreciation: slisBNB holdersâ€™ share of the BNB pool keeps increasing due to the increase in the slisBNB/BNB exchange-rate.
* **5% goes to the protocol**.&#x20;
