# About slisBNB

slisBNB is the yield bearing & liquid staking token for Synclub, which appreciates against BNB in line with BNBâ€™s staking APR.

Unlike traditional staking, where staked assets are locked in the contract, liquid staked tokens can be transacted or used as collateral to earn yield across the DeFi ecosystem.

With slisBNB, users have the freedom to earn additional yields on different DeFi platforms while earning staking rewards passively.
