# Add Liquidity to lisUSD

Liquidity pools, essential for decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and DeFi platforms, consist of two or more tokens locked in a smart contract. Users who provide liquidity to these pools receive LP tokens in return, representing their share of the pool and allowing them to earn a portion of the trading fees.

There are several DEX options to add liquidity with your borrowed lisUSD, and will release them step by step. Currently, we offer [liquidity pools on Uniswap](liquidity-pools-on-uniswap.md).

## Adding Liquidity to lisUSD Token Pairs

1. Connect Wallet: Connect your compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the DEX or DeFi platform supporting lisUSD.
2. Select Token Pair: Choose the lisUSD token pair you'd like to provide liquidity for (e.g., lisUSD-BNB).
3. Deposit Tokens: Deposit an equal value of both tokens in the selected pair.
4. Confirm Transaction: Approve the transaction, receiving LP tokens representing your pool share.

## Adding Liquidity to lisUSD-Only Pools

1. Connect Wallet: Connect your wallet to the DeFi platform offering lisUSD-only pools.
2. Select lisUSD Pool: Choose the lisUSD-only pool you'd like to provide liquidity to.
3. Deposit lisUSD: Deposit your lisUSD tokens into the pool.

Following these steps, you can successfully add liquidity to lisUSD token pairs or lisUSD-only pools and earn rewards as a liquidity provider.
