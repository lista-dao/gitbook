### Lista Mechanism: Earning Rewards through Strategic Asset Utilization

In the Lista mechanism, users can strategically utilize their assets—such as BNB, ETH, slisBNB, wBETH, and BTCB—to earn various rewards. The process involves several key steps:

#### 1. **Deposit Assets into the Interaction (CDP) Module**

* Users start by depositing their assets into the Interaction (CDP) module, where these assets serve as collateral.
* By using this collateral, users can borrow **LisUSD**.

#### 2. **Borrow and Stake LisUSD**

* After borrowing LisUSD, users have the option to stake it in the **Jar Contract**.
* Both the staked amount and the borrowed LisUSD are tracked by the **ListaDistributor Contract** to calculate rewards.

#### 3. **Stake BNB for slisBNB and Earn Rewards**

* Users can stake BNB through the **Stake Manager** to receive **slisBNB**.
* slisBNB not only earns bi-weekly **LISTA token rewards** but can also be used as collateral to borrow more LisUSD, which can yield additional rewards.

#### 4. **Direct BNB Rewards**

* Users can also directly earn BNB rewards by staking BNB.

#### 5. **Lock LISTA Tokens in veLista for Additional Rewards**

* By locking LISTA tokens in the **veLista contract**, users are eligible to receive additional LISTA token rewards.
