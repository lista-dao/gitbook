# veLISTA

LISTA is the governance token for Lista DAO, it is distributed to users of the protocol for performing a variety of actions, and can be locked to mint veLISTA which allows users to participate in protocol governance, such as raising proposals and voting on them on Lista DAO’s [Snapshot platform](https://snapshot.org/#/listavote.eth).

## veLISTA Locking mechanics

Participating in Lista DAO’s governance requires that a user lock an amount of LISTA tokens. Once locked, the user will receive veLISTA, which is used in determining voting power.

Lista's token locking into veLISTA is inspired by, and functions similarly to, the popular veToken model created by Curve.

### How Locking Works

1. Users receive veLISTA by locking LISTA for a number of weeks. "Weeks" refers to the number of weeks that must pass before the tokens can be withdrawn. The maximum duration for a lock is 52 weeks.
2. The longer the lock duration, the more veLISTA the user receives.
3. Each address can only have 1 lock with 1 unlock duration.
4. It is possible to increase the amount of veLISTA locked, as well as extending the duration of an existing lock.
5. Every Wednesday at UTC+0, the number of weeks for a lock decreases by 1. When the lock duration reaches 0 weeks, the tokens may be withdrawn at any time.

### Withdrawing early from Locked Positions

It is possible to exit a locked position early by paying an Early Claim fee.  The fee to exit early starts at 100% and decays linearly based on the number of weeks remaining until the tokens unlock. The exact calculation used is:

Early Claim Fee = (total\_Locked\_amount \* weeks\_to\_unlock)/52

## Governance

### Scope

Voting empowers the Lista DAO community, allowing members to influence and shape the future development of Lista DAO. As Lista DAO matures, more power will be gradually transferred to the DAO. Our ultimate goal is to fully transition into a DAO where governance holds absolute power.

Explore Lista DAO’s native voting portal on Snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/listavote.eth).

veLISTA holders possess voting rights within Lista’s governance system. As Lista DAO matures, more topics will be added into the scope for governance. The following topics currently falls within the scope of governance:

(1) Modifying fees rate: withdrawal fees, early Claim fees for veLISTA

(2) Adding or removing a collateral

(3) Increase and decrease Collateral Rate and collateral debt cap

(4) Protocol fee sharing for veLISTA holder

(5) Voting on the share of LISTA Emission on Liquidity Pool

All governance proposals must be voted on by veLISTA holders, while only the Lista DAO Core team can submit proposals. The results of proposals will be implemented by the Lista DAO team.

Community proposals, posted by the Lista DAO community, are used to propose ideas and express the community’s point of view. The Lista DAO team will incorporate well-supported ideas or designs into Core proposals. Additionally, community members can provide feedback and make suggestions on our Forum, contributing to the ongoing development of the protocol.

### Voting Threshold

Governance of Lista DAO operates under specific rules & conditions:

1. Voting Eligibility: Users with any amount of veLISTA are entitled to vote on proposals. Their voting power is directly proportional to the amount of veLISTA they hold relative to other veLISTA holders.
2. Proposal Submission: Only core team members can submit proposals for voting.
3. Voting period: Each proposal’s voting period will last for a period of 3 days, before the final results are tallied.
4. Proposal Approval: A proposal is considered approved when it receives support from over 50% of the veLISTA tokens cast in the vote.
5. Implementation: Once a proposal is passed, it will be implemented within 1 to 2 weeks. If there are delays due to special circumstances, the Lista core team will provide an explanation.

### Veto

The Lista DAO Core Team has always prioritized the best interests of Lista DAO. That said, the team retains veto rights and can take corrective actions to ensure the security and proper functioning of the protocol without a Snapshot poll. In any veto action, the Lista Core Team will provide a detailed explanation to the community.

Possible actions include, but are not limited to:

* Pausing relevant smart contracts to fix a critical bug in the protocol
* Rejecting a successfully added gauge if the token(s) in question are deemed unsafe, malicious, and/or detrimental to the Lista’s ecosystem

## Revenue Sharing

### veLISTA Revenue Share

veLISTA’s revenue share will be calculated by following the simple formula of:

veLISTA revenue share = LISTA platform revenue - Lista general operational costs

Over 50% of the revenue will be distributed to $veLISTA holders.

### Lista DAO’s Primary Revenue Sources

Lista DAO’s primary revenue includes (but not limited to) the following:

1. veLISTA early claim fees
2. lisUSD borrowing fees
3. ETH withdrawal fees
4. LST rewards and operation Commission fees

| lisUSD    | Risk Buffer Fund           | A risk buffer for lisUSD is set aside, which serves to cover any potential shortfalls that may happen during black swan events.                                                                   | Live   |
| Lista DAO | Operational cost           | A portion of Lista DAO’s revenue will be set aside for operational costs, which will be calculated manually.                                                                                      | Live   |
