lisUSD is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral backed destablecoin soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Users who have collateralized their assets via Lista are eligible to take out a loan in lisUSD against their collateral. lisUSD is generated, backed, and kept stable through collateral assets that are deposited into CeVault functioning as the Lista collateral vault.

Users can borrow lisUSD by depositing collateral assets into CeVault within Lista. This is how lisUSD is entered into circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain lisUSD by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by staking lisUSD through LPs on external DEXs. Once generated, bought, or received, lisUSD can be used in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency: it can be sent to others and used as payments for goods and services.

## Lista[​](https://helio.money/docs/tokenomics#helio) <a href="#helio" id="helio"></a>

The native cryptographically-secure fungible protocol token of Lista DAO (LISTA) is a transferable representation of attributed governance and utility functions specified in the protocol/code of Lista DAO, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.

LISTA is a functional multi-utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants on Lista DAO in a decentralised manner. The goal of introducing LISTA is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on Lista DAO without any intermediaries such as centralised third party entity/institution/credit. It is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not exclusively provided by the issuer. LISTA does not in any way represent any shareholding, ownership, participation, right, title, or interest in Lista DAO, any affiliate, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will LISTA entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Seychelles, Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. LISTA may only be utilised on Lista DAO, and ownership of the same carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use LISTA as a means to enable usage of and interaction within Lista DAO. The secondary market pricing of LISTA is not dependent on the effort of the Lista DAO, and there is no token functionality or scheme designed to control or manipulate such secondary pricing.

For the avoidance of doubt, Lista DAO does not deal in, or is it in the business of buying or selling any virtual asset or digital payment token (including LISTA). Any sale or distribution of tokens would be performed during a restricted initial period solely for the purpose of obtaining project development funds, raising market/brand awareness, as well as community building and social engagement; this is not conducted with any element of repetitiveness or regularity which would constitute a business.

Further, LISTA provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and participation in the ecosystem on Lista DAO, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. LISTA is an integral and indispensable part of Lista DAO, because without LISTA, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the ecosystem. Given that additional LISTA will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on Lista DAO and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of Lista DAO and/or holders of LISTA which did not actively participate will not receive any LISTA incentives.

LISTA is a BEP-20 and ERC-20 compatible token. Its core functions within Lista DAO are:

To promote decentralised community governance for the network, LISTA would allow holders to propose and vote on governance proposals to determine future features, upgrades and/or parameters of Lista DAO (e.g. allocation of revenue pool for ecosystem development and growth, adding of new vaults, protocol parameters and fee levels), or provide feedback. The right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Lista DAO; it does not entitle LISTA holders to vote on the operation and management of Lista DAO, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors or similar bodies of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, nor does LISTA constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership.

Users would be able to earn LISTA tokens for their participation and engagement with the protocol, for example depositing or staking with Lista DAO, performing transactions, and/or engaging in governance.

### LISTA's liquidity[​](https://helio.money/docs/tokenomics#helios-liquidity) <a href="#helios-liquidity" id="helios-liquidity"></a>

Similar to lisUSD, LISTA token is a medium of exchange in its own right, which can be swapped or put in a farming pool on a DEX at the user’s discretion, e.g. to maximise their capital efficiency, obtain borrowings, and/or compound their yield.
