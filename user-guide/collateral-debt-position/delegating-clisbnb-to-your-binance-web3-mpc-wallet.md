# Delegating clisBNB to your Binance web3 MPC Wallet

It is important to note that the **delegation of clisBNB happens when users deposit BNB as a collateral on Lista DAO**. Once your BNB has been deposited, the clisBNB that users obtain will be fixed to that particular address, and it will not be tradeable.

To change the destination address of your clisBNB. You will have to withdraw your BNB (Which will take 7–15days), and in this case, the clisBNB will be burnt accordingly. If you are unsure of how clisBNB operates, do refer to our product update [here](https://medium.com/listadao/product-update-introducing-clisbnb-b64bc353f0ac).
