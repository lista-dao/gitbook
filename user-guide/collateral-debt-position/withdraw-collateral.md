# Withdraw collateral

{% hint style="info" %}
**Longer vs instant withdrawal**

Before withdrawing, please ensure your outstanding loan is repaid to avoid liquidation of your collateral.

\
**BNB**

BNB takes 7â€“15 days to be withdrawn, while withdrawing BNB LSTs (Eg. slisBNB) is immediate.

slisBNB is the interest-bearing BNB staking asset and allows you either exchange it for BNB on major DEXs or hold and keep getting BNB Staking rewards that accumulate in slisBNB over time. The longer you hold, the more BNB you'll get when exchanging BNB LSTs to BNB.



The minimum amount to withdraw is 0.1 BNB.
{% endhint %}

To withdraw your BNB:

1. On the [borrow page ](https://helio.money/app/loans/), click the **-** button under **My Collateral** to withdraw your BNB.
2. On the next page, enter the desired amount to withdraw and choose the option: BNB or BNB LSTs. Then click **Proceed**.
3. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask to receive the withdrawn assets to the connected MetaMask wallet address.
4. Once the transaction completes, click **Okay** to go back to the borrow page.
