# Farming on Thena

Farming on Thena consists of two major steps:

1. Depositing lisUSD and your desired pair token in exchange for sAMM-lisUSD pair tokens.
2. Staking sAMM-lisUSD pair tokens.

Taking out your LP tokens and liquidity consists of two major steps:

1. Unstaking your LP tokens.
2. Removing liquidity from the respective lisUSD pair pool.
