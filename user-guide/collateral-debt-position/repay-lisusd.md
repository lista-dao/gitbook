# Repay lisUSD

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**

The **Approve** transaction does not mean the repayment is complete.&#x20;

\
Your loan cannot go under 15 lisUSD, so you can either choose to repay it to the remainder of 15 lisUSD or in full.
{% endhint %}

To repay back your lisUSD loan:

1. Head over to your Lista DAO CDP dashboard [here](https://lista.org/cdp/dashboard).
