# Repay lisUSD

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**

The **Approve** transaction does not mean the repayment is complete.&#x20;

\
Your loan cannot go under 15 lisUSD, so you can either choose to repay it to the remainder of 15 lisUSD or in full.
{% endhint %}

To repay back your lisUSD loan:

1. On the [borrow page](https://helio.money/app/loans/), click **Repay** under **My Borrowed Funds**.
2. On the next page, enter the amount of lisUSD you intend to repay back and click **Approve**.
3. Confirm the action in MetaMask.
4. After the approval is complete, click **Proceed** to submit the repaying transaction.
5. Once the transaction completes, click **Okay** to go to the borrow page and see if the outstanding loan is repaid.
