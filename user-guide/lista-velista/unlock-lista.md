# Unlock LISTA

Users can unlock their LISTA token anytime they want by paying an Early unlock Fee. If they want to avoid paying the Early Unlock Fee, they will have to wait until the lock period ends.&#x20;

Do note that if users want to avoid paying any early Unlock fees, they will have to turn off the auto lock function, and wait for their LISTA tokens to be fully unlocked.&#x20;

Here’s how you can do it:

1. Head over to Lista DAO’s locking page [here](https://lista.org/lock), and connect your wallet to Lista DAO’s DApp.

3. A pop-up will appear, showing you the exact amount of Early Unlock Fees that you need to pay in order to unlock your locked LISTA tokens. \
   \
   If you have completed the locking period before claiming your tokens, the early Unlock fee will be 0, and you do not have to pay any additional fees. Once you have confirmed the Early Unlock Fee amount, click on “unlock”, and sign the transaction.
