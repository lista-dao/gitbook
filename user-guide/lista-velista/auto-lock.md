# Auto lock

Users can choose to turn on the “Auto lock” function anytime they want to avoid the hassle of manually relocking their LISTA tokens every week. Users can also choose the number of weeks that they would like to auto lock their LISTA at.&#x20;

Here is how you can do it:

1. Head over to Lista DAO’s locking page [here](https://lista.org/lock), and connect your wallet to Lista DAO’s DApp.

3. Users can choose to auto lock their LISTA tokens for any amount of time in perpetuity, between 1 to 52 weeks. In this example, we are choosing to auto lock LISTA tokens perpetually at 20 weeks. Once you have confirmed the autolock period, turn on the Auto lock function in step 2, and a pop-up will appear. Click on “confirm”, and sign the transaction.&#x20;
